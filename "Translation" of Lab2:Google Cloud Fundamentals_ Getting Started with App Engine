Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with App Engine


Task 1: Initialize App Engine
#Initialize your App Engine app with your project and choose its region:

gcloud app create --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID

#When prompted, select the region where you want your App Engine application located.

#Clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello_world directory:

git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples

#Navigate to the source directory:

cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

Task 2: Run Hello World application locally
#Download and update the packages list.

sudo apt-get update

#Set up a virtual environment in which you will run your application.

sudo apt-get install virtualenv

#If prompted [Y/n], press Y and then Enter.

virtualenv -p python3 venv

#Activate the virtual environment.

source venv/bin/activate

#Navigate to your project directory and install dependencies.

pip install  -r requirements.txt

#Run the application:

python main.py

#In Cloud Shell, click Web preview (Web Preview) > Preview on port 8080 to preview the application.


#Press Ctrl+C to abort the deployed service.


Task 3: Deploy and run Hello World on App Engine
#To deploy your application to the App Engine Standard environment:

#Navigate to the source directory:

cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

#Deploy your Hello World application.

gcloud app deploy

#If prompted "Do you want to continue (Y/n)?", press Y and then Enter.

#Launch your browser to view the app at http://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com

gcloud app browse

#If cloud shell doesn't automatically open the window press the url provided  to see your results.

Task 4: Disable the application
#App Engine offers no option to Undeploy an application.However,
you can disable billing and release all the Google Cloud resources that are being used in your Cloud project by shutting down that project by:

gcloud projects delete


#end lab
